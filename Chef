cookbook is a collection of recipe and some other files and folder.
inside cookbook
chefignore like gitignore
kitchen yml - for testing cookbook
metadata rb(tell ruby ) - name version author etc of cookbook
      recipe.rb
readme.md
recipe - where you write code
test - for integration testing

lab steps
which chef
mkdir cookbook
ls
cd cookbooks/
chef generarte cookbook test-cookbook
atp install tree -y
tree

chef generate cookbook xyz
chef generate recipe xyz
cd test-cookbook/
chef generate recipe <name>
vi test-cookbook/recipes/test-recipe.rb
tree

  file '/myfile' do
  content 'Welcome to Technical Guftgu'
  action :create
  end

  chef spec ruby -c test-cookbook/recipes test-recipe.rb

  syntax is ok then good otherwise check

  chef-client -zr ""recipe-cookbook::
                            test-recipe]"
    ls /


                              create and write second recipe

package 'tree' do
action :install
end

file '/myfile2' do
content 'This is My Second Project code'
action :create
owner 'root'
group 'root'
end 

                              to test 
chef-client -zr "recipe[test-cookbook::recipe2]"
cat /myfile2
apt remove tree -y
chef-client -zr "recipe[test-cookbook::recipe2]" 


package 'httpd' do
action :install
end

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
content 'Welcome to Technical Guftgu'
action :create
end


service 'httpd' do
action [:enable, :start]
end

chef exec ruby -c apache-cookbook /recipe/apache-recipe.rb

                           keywords

Resource - it is the basic component of a recipe used to manage the infra with
different  kind of states there can be multiple resources in a recipe which 
will help in configuring and managing the infrastructure 
for eg - iac

package- manages the packages ona node
service - manages the service on a node
user - manage the user on the node
group - manage group
template - manage the files with embedded ruby template
cookbook file - transfer the files from the files subdirectory in the cookbook
to the location on the node
file - manage the content of a file on the node
execute - execute the commands on the node
cron - edits an existing cron file on the node
directory - manage the directory on the node.

                      chef attribute
attribute is key value pair of something of a particular data.
# Types of attribute
   - default  (lowest priority)     
   - force default                    lower
   - normal                             to
   - override                         higher
   - force - override
   - automatic  (highest priority)
 

attribute define by ohie has the highest priority

we declare variable in cookbook using #
 for ex
 file '/basicinfo' do
 content "This is to get Attributes
 HOSTNAME: #{node['hostname']}
 IPADDRESS: #{node['ipaddress']}
 CPU: #{node['cpu']['0']['mhz']}
 MEMORY: #{node['memory']['total']}"
 owner 'root'
 group 'root'
 action :create
 end

tyep ohai in cmd.
ohai ipaddress - gives ip address.
ohai hostname - gives hostname.

Ohai is a tool in Chef Infra that gathers system 
information about the node. It collects details like:
✅ CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, OS details
✅ Installed packages and running processes
✅ Cloud metadata (AWS, Azure, etc.)

Chef uses Ohai to generate automatic attributes, 
which are available in recipes.

A node in Chef is any system (server, VM, container, etc.) that 
is managed by the Chef Infra Client.

Types of Nodes:
Physical or Virtual Machines (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows Server)

Cloud Instances (AWS EC2, Azure VM)

Containers (Docker, Kubernetes Pods)

runlist -- the recipes which will in line with the default recipe to execute is known as runlist

convergence - to execute all recipes and run is known as convergence.
